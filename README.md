# Antidepressant use during pregnancy and miscarriage: a systematic review and meta-analysis

**Background** Literature surrounding the association between antidepressant use during pregnancy and miscarriage is conflicting. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies among pregnant women regarding the association between exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy and the risk of miscarriage, compared with pregnant women not exposed to antidepressants.

**Design** We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of non-randomised studies.

**Data sources** We searched Medline, Embase and PsychINFO up to 6 August 2023.

**Eligibility criteria and outcomes** Case-control, cohort and cross-sectional study designs were selected if they compared individuals exposed to any antidepressant class during pregnancy to comparator groups of either no antidepressant use or an alternate antidepressant.

**Data extraction and synthesis** Effect estimates were extracted from selected studies and pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-Randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool, and heterogeneity assessed using the I2 statistic. Subgroup analyses were used to explore antidepressant classes and the impact of confounding by indication.

**Results** 1800 records were identified from the search, of which 29 were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The total sample included 5 671 135 individuals. Antidepressant users initially appeared to have a higher risk of miscarriage compared with unexposed individuals from the general population (summary effect estimate: 1.24, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.31, I2=69.2%; number of studies (n)=29). However, the summary estimate decreased when comparing against unexposed individuals with maternal depression (1.16, 1.04 to 1.31; I2=58.6%; n=6), suggesting confounding by indication may be driving the association. 22 studies suffered from serious RoB, and only two of the 29 studies were deemed at moderate RoB.

**Conclusions** After accounting for maternal depression, there is little evidence of any association between antidepressant use during pregnancy and miscarriage. Instead, the results indicate the biasing impact of confounding by indication.

# Antidepressant use during pregnancy and stillbirth: a systematic review and meta-analysis

> Martin FZ[^*], Smith S[^*]: My reference., Rai D, Forbes H. Antidepressant use during pregnancy and risk of stillbirth: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Reproductive, Female and Child Health. 2023; 2: 177-187. doi:10.1002/rfc2.38

**Introduction** To evaluate the current evidence estimating the association between antidepressant use during pregnancy and stillbirth.

**Search Strategy** MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO for studies investigating antidepressant use during pregnancy and risk of stillbirth, from inception until 21 January 2022.

**Selection Criteria** Studies including pregnant women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy investigating stillbirth were eligible, compared with either unexposed, indicated pregnant women or unexposed women in the general obstetric population.

**Data Collection and Analysis** Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two authors independently. Meta-analysis was used to generate pooled-effect estimates, and the ROBINS-I tool was used to assess risk of bias for individual studies.

**Main Results** Seventeen studies were eligible. Although estimates from meta-analysis models suggest a small increased risk of stillbirth, summary effect estimate 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06, 1.34) between those individuals taking antidepressants during pregnancy and all other pregnant women, confounding control is likely inadequate. The risk of bias assessment showed most studies were low quality, with no studies scoring low risk; in a meta-analysis of studies with moderate risk of bias (n = 2), no association was noted, summary effect estimate 1.17 (95% CI 0.97, 1.41). Only six studies adjusted for confounding by indication, the findings of which were summarised narratively.

**Conclusions** Although the overall meta-analysis found a small association between antidepressant use during pregnancy and stillbirth, this result was likely due to the overall low quality of studies included and by confounding in the underlying studies. Future studies must adequately address potential confounding by indication.
